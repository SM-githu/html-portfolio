<h1> Sarayu's Favorite Movies </h1>
<h2>3 movies I enjoy</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Polite Society</h3>
<p>This movie is denfintly an all time favorite because I adored all the twists and it's a very action-packed movie. It kept me on my toes the entire time.</p>
<h3>Kalki</h3>
<p>The was by far one of the most groundbreaking movies I've ever seen. The graphics, actors, set, plot, everything about has been done to near perfection. Alougth this was an intense movie, I still quite enjoyed it. The 1st part was sad and frightining, but the 2nd part is where I most liked the flim.</p>
<h3>The Princess Switch</h3>
<p>I quite liked this movie. Lighthearted and funny, I see no reason to dislike it. Sure, there are some cringy parts, but overall great sleepover flim, and spectacular for kids! Plot is well thought out and the charecters are enjoyable. </p>
